# Collecting Badge Types
Step 1 is all about connecting to all of the different "badge types": Human, Goon, Creator, Speaker, Artist, Vendor, and Press. 

## Connection methods
There are two ways to connect badges with other people, one physical and one based on keys generated on the badge and passed to other people.

### Physical Connection
The DC29 badges have a connector on each side, 2 male and 2 female. Connect a male to a female to link badges. A successful connection will lead to a sound being played, different played sounds have different meanings

- *Multiple beep chime*: Successful connection
- *Single beep*: Badge was already connected

### Key exchange

The badge serial interface has the ability to generate "Requests" and "Replies" which can be used to connect badges remotely. A request is generated with no input and allows a separate attendee to generate a reply.
A reply is generated using a given "request" as input and can be passed back to the person that generated the request in order to complete the connection. Note that inputting a reply only connects the badges on one end, you must repeat the process with the other attendee generating a request in order to connect both ways like would happen with a physical connection	.


## The signal

Some attendees are infected with "the signal", connect with these users to get one missing badge type for free.

## Completion

Once all badge types are collected, you've completed step 1.

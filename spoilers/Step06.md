```
Chip shortages are bad this year, but this isnâ€™t the first time
there have been sourcing issues for DEF CON badges. In one case,
it caused the same IC to be used 2 years in a row.

According to [this pdf](http://grandideastudio.com/wp-content/uploads/history_of_defcon_electronic_badges_slides.pdf) DEFCON used the following chips:

DC14: PIC something
DC15: MC9S08QG8
DC16: MC9S08JM60
DC17: MC56F8006VLC
DC18: MC56F8006VLC

So the chip MC56F8006VLC was used twice in a row,

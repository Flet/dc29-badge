"Hackers have disabled our broadcast. Don't let them stop the signal!"

This is in reference to the back of the badge where several TVs are connected by a wire that leads out the bottom left of the badge back.

When you connect these pads, you reconnect "the signal" and are given a new clue in the terminal of the badge. /WatchYourHead

If you want to skip soldering, use a pencil to scribble in the space between the pads to connect them.

# dc29-badge

## Firmware
To get started, please update your firmware.

* Step 1: You will need to download new firmware for your badge to participate, this firmware can be found here https://defcon.org/signal/ (this link can be found in the topic of #dc29-badge as well if you don't trust me).
* Step 2: Connect your badge to your PC with usb-c on badge side, and usb-a on computer. Turn power switch from battery to USB while holding down the bottom right button, your badge should glow red.
* Step 3: You should see your badge as an attached USB drive. Drag and drop the new firmware into your badge. It should automatically reboot.

## Connecting from computer

For *macOS*, you can run `screen /dev/tty.usbmodem123451 9600` which will present a black screen, then press enter. For *linux*, use the previous command with 'sudo'.

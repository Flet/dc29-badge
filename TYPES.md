# Badge/Signal Types

There are 7 known badge types:

Human,Goon,Creator,Speaker,Artist,Vendor,Press

# The Signal

When a badge has paired with all known badge types (see above) that badge will recieve "The Signal" and will be able to impersonate another badge type - E.g., if a user who has paired with a Human, Goon, Creator, and Speaker badge, when that user pairs to a Signal badge, they will receive a signature as if they had connected to either an Artist, Vendor, or Press badge - regardless of what the original type of the Signal badge is.
